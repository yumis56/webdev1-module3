### Important Considerations for Grading 

- Carefully review the code comments in the web page for guidance: [HTML Comments](src/index.html) and [CSS Comments](src/css/main.css).
- Focus on understanding how the CSS layout works, and how variables and the calc function make the layout easier to adapt.
- Thoroughly review all the provided content to enhance your technical skills, communication abilities, and design prowess.
- Use images from "Creative Commons", Unsplash's "free" stock images, AI-generated images, or similar sources. Ensure the images are copyright compliant. Always cite the source and check the licensing requirements.

### Grading Rubric - All or Nothing

Your assignment will be graded based on:

1. The presence of the required screenshots of the resume in the Readme.md file. Assignments lacking this will receive a zero with no option for resubmission.
2. The professional styling of your resume and its alignment with the chosen brand archetype. Inadequate attempts will score zero, but you can receive feedback via the discussion board if you draft the assignment at least three days before the due date.
3. Passing all Playwright tests.

### Peer Feedback and Discussion

Participate in the Canvas discussion board to share your work and receive constructive feedback from your peers and the instructor. The exchange of honest yet respectful feedback is crucial to our collective learning journey. Here's a [Toastmasters guide](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/toastmasters-effective-feedback) on giving effective feedback.
